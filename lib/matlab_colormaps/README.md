# MATLAB Colormaps

A collection of scientific and aesthetic colormaps usable in MATLAB, currently under construction!

All colormaps are designed to function exactly like the built-ins:
- Call `viridis` or `viridis()` to return a `256 x 3` array of RGB color values in the range `[0,1]`.
- Call `viridis(m)` to return an `m x 3` array of RGB color values in the range `[0,1]`, interpolated linearly from the base data.

To showcase any colormap against several tests and samples, call `showcase_cmap(viridis)`.
